Question - Given a binary tree, find the Postorder Traversal of it.
For Example, the postorder traversal of the following tree is:
5 10 39 1

        1
     /     \
   10     39
  /
5


Example 1:

Input:
        19
     /     \
    10      8
  /    \
 11    13
Output: 11 13 10 8 19
Example 2:

Input:
          11
         /
       15
      /
     7
Output: 7 15 11

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).


Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 105
0 <= Data of a node <= 106
