Question - The task is to complete the insert() function which is used to implement Insertion Sort.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = { 4, 1, 3, 9, 7}
Output:
1 3 4 7 9
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
